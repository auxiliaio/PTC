Our treatment programs focus on personal spiritual growth in recovery.<br>\nSuccessful recovery encompasses several changes, including improvement in self-esteem, interpersonal relationships, improvement in family interaction, formation of a meaningful and workable relationship with a power greater than him\/her, vocational productivity, the establishment and attainment of realistic life goals and a healthy lifestyle.<br>\nThe basis of our treatment is on the belief that the chemically dependent person has the capacity to abstain from mood altering drugs (MAD\u2019s) and the capacity to actualize his\/her human potential. We also note that those who experience addiction are often prone to other addictive behaviors e.g. those addicted to alcohol may also be prone to sex addiction, pathological gambling, compulsive eating, compulsive spending, workaholics etc. It\u2019s also common for those in recovery to \u201ccross-over\u201d to another form of addiction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The aim of our program is to help a chemically dependent person achieve:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Abstinence from all mood altering drugs, and<\/li><li>Change in lifestyle<br>\nChange is a life-long process hence the attainment of all these goals will take time.
